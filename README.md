# A11y WebVR

This repository is a place for me to test different concepts for accessibility in webVR.

## Ideas

A mixture of all ideas. Small or Big.

- Video with `.vtt` subtitles.
- Video with sign language option?
- "Sticky" cursor (for smaller buttons or people with motor impairment).
- For people that have a hard time turning around. (Turning the world around you instead of you.)
- Screenreader and keyboard, hide HTML elements behind the scene and connect these to the buttons and objects inside VR.
- Sound option for mono and stereo (For example when deaf on one ear or one broken earbud).
- Option for a standing or sitting experience.
- Move "cursor" with touch pad for when user can't use arm to point.
- Good focus indicator. Even for when looking outside the "correct" view.
- Translate keyboard events (Tab or Enter) to controller events.


## Testing
